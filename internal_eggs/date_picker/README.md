Parabeac eggs are plugins were created to make sure developers could create plugins that changed the way code would be exported.

## Getting started

Clone this repository into your local computer. This will give you a template to kick start the development of your template; it includes all your need create a custom template.

There are a couple of things to keep in mind while developing your plugin.
1. Make sure you have a semantic for your plugin, it could be anything; make sure to communicate the semantic with the designer.
2. Make sure you are extending the correct plugin class.
3. Finally, place your plugin in the plugins directory inside of Parabeac Core.

After this, you can run Parabeac Core and watch your plugin do its magic!
